NOTES:
-figure out how to store previously made projects
-start putting then on
-memorize branching and pull requests steps 
-find some(3)potential open source projects to work on
-attach other projects to this page? would make it easier to find them, not actually necessary b/c attached to my profile
-figure out how to set up automatic additions from atom to github




Below is the automatic stuff, it is going to be removed soon!
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Kristina01111000/Kristina01111000.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Kristina01111000/Kristina01111000.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
